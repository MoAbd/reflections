*How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
-it was very helpful and easy to use.

*How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
-can learn from my mistakes i did in this files and get the experience.

*What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit,like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?-pros 
 it is changed when i want , so i can go to history later and see records
 easily see diff between two commits
-cons
 need time and effort to commit each single locical change

*Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
-when changing a feature ,it needs multiple files to be changed .
so easily we can see related files and change them.

*How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
-first (git log) shows all commits added to the repository.
-then we can choose commit to see changes happened by (git diff this_id previous_id)
